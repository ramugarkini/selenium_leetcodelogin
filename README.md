# Automation Code Summary

## Purpose
The Python code utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automate actions on the LeetCode website, such as logging in, navigating to specific pages, retrieving data, and logging out.

## Code Overview
- Imports necessary modules from Selenium and time.
- Defines a function to read credentials from a file.
- Creates a Firefox WebDriver instance with options set for headless mode and binary location.
- Opens the LeetCode login page, reads credentials from a file, and fills in the login form.
- Finds and clicks the "Sign In" button.
- Retrieves data from a specified path on the page.
- Navigates to specific URLs and performs similar actions.
- Logs out from the LeetCode account.
- Closes the browser window.

## Usage
1. Replace `'/path/to/your_credentials.txt'` with the actual path to your credentials file.
2. Uncomment `firefox_options.add_argument('--headless')` if you want to run in headless mode.
3. Modify `firefox_options.binary_location` as needed for your Firefox binary location.

## Notes
- Adjust time delays (`time.sleep()`) as per your website's loading times.
- Update CSS selectors and element IDs if there are any changes on the LeetCode website.

## Conclusion
This code provides a foundation for automating interactions with the LeetCode website using Selenium WebDriver and Python.
